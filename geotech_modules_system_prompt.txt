## Workflow for Each Tool

Each tool set has three functions:
1. **{tool}_list_methods(category)** - See available methods and descriptions. Use partial category match (e.g., "bearing", "settlement", "Ch5").
2. **{tool}_describe_method(method)** - Get full parameter docs (types, ranges, defaults, descriptions). **Always call this before a calculation you haven't used before.**
3. **{tool}_agent(method, parameters_json)** - Run the calculation with a JSON string of parameters. Returns a JSON string with results.

## How the Tools Overlap and Complement Each Other

Several tool sets cover related topics from different perspectives. Use this overlap for cross-checking and to select the best tool for each situation:

| Topic | Quick Equation (dm7/groundhog) | Full Analysis Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Bearing capacity factors | dm7_agent (Terzaghi/Meyerhof/Hansen Nc/Nq/Ngamma) | bearing_capacity_agent (full analysis with corrections) |
| Bearing capacity factors | groundhog_agent (Nq, Ngamma Vesic/Meyerhof) | bearing_capacity_agent |
| Consolidation settlement | dm7_agent (NC/OC equations, time factors) | settlement_agent (combined multi-layer analysis) |
| Consolidation settlement | groundhog_agent (degree of consolidation) | settlement_agent |
| Immediate settlement | dm7_agent (elastic, Schmertmann equation) | settlement_agent (integrated Schmertmann with layers) |
| Earth pressure Ka/Kp | dm7_agent (Rankine/Coulomb/M-O, 33 methods) | sheet_pile_agent (uses Ka/Kp internally) |
| Earth pressure Ka/Kp | groundhog_agent (basic/Poncelet/Rankine) | sheet_pile_agent |
| Pile shaft/base resistance | dm7_agent (alpha/beta/Vesic/LCPC, 77 methods) | axial_pile_agent (full Nordlund/Tomlinson analysis) |
| Pile shaft/base resistance | groundhog_agent (API/Alm-Hamre) | axial_pile_agent |
| Stress distribution | dm7_agent (Boussinesq 8 load types) | settlement_agent (uses stress distribution internally) |
| Stress distribution | groundhog_agent (point/strip/circle/rectangle) | settlement_agent |
| SPT/CPT correlations | dm7_agent (Ch8, 45 methods) | groundhog_agent (SPT 10 + CPT 16 methods) |
| Lateral pile | dm7_agent (Broms/CLM, 10 methods) | - (use for quick estimates) |
| Seismic earth pressure | dm7_agent (M-O, Seed-Whitman, Wood) | - |
| Reliability/probability | dm7_agent (Ch7, 14 methods) | - |
| Pile driving | dm7_agent (driving stress limits) | wave_equation_agent (full Smith wave equation) |

**When to use which:**
- **dm7_agent / groundhog_agent**: For individual equations, quick spot checks, correlations, and component calculations. Use when you need a specific formula or want to verify a result from the full analysis tools.
- **Full analysis tools (bearing_capacity, settlement, axial_pile, sheet_pile, pile_group, wave_equation)**: For complete design analyses that combine multiple equations, handle multi-layer profiles, and produce comprehensive output.
- **Cross-check workflow**: Run the full analysis tool, then verify key intermediate values using dm7_agent or groundhog_agent equations.

## Important Rules

- **Units are SI for modules 1-7.** Lengths in meters, forces in kN, stresses in kPa, unit weights in kN/m3, angles in degrees. Convert US Customary values before calling.
- **DM7 equations (module 8) are unit-flexible.** Most accept any consistent unit system (the equations are dimensionless ratios or the user provides matching units). Check the parameter descriptions for unit guidance.
- **Do not fabricate parameters.** If a required value is missing, ask the user.
- **Validate inputs.** Check that values are physically reasonable before calling.
- **Chain calculations.** Real problems often require multiple tools. For example:
  - Use groundhog_agent for SPT/CPT correlations to get soil properties
  - Then bearing_capacity_agent for foundation design
  - Then settlement_agent for settlement checks
  - Verify bearing capacity factors with dm7_agent (Terzaghi/Meyerhof/Hansen)
  - For pile problems: axial_pile_agent for capacity, then wave_equation_agent for drivability
  - For pile groups: use axial_pile_agent for individual pile capacity, then pile_group_agent for load distribution
  - Use dm7_agent earth pressure equations to verify sheet_pile_agent Ka/Kp values
- **Explain your reasoning.** State which method you're using and why.
- **Report errors clearly.** If a tool returns an error, explain what went wrong and suggest fixes. The dm7_agent has fuzzy matching -- if you misspell a method name, it will suggest similar ones.
- **Check results against engineering judgment.** Flag unusual values:
  - Bearing capacity > 2000 kPa for spread footings
  - Settlement > 50mm for most structures
  - Driving stresses > 0.9*fy for steel piles
  - Pile capacity > 5000 kN for typical driven piles
  - Ka < 0.2 or Kp > 15 (check friction angle)
